# Todo
- Modify branch and bound (without lower bounds)
- Add lower bounds.
- Correct input from attribute table
- correct branch and bound exporting for carpooling
- Use Vehicle needed to peek lowest time needed to go from depot and comeback.

# Done
- Modify the Branch and bound algorithm for new input and model
- Add depot edges to lower bound
- correct GA algorithm for car pooling
- correct input files for carpooling (remove customer penalty and due dates)
- correct branch and bound for carpooling
- remove customer Due Dates
- Make Car pooling Branch
- Implement the Genetic Algorithm
- Generate the answer nodes wtk file with additional info
- export the answer routes wtk file
- Read from Nodes attribute table
- Correct the data types (int -> double)
- Read from Roads attribute table
- Add lower bound for additional penalty taken
- Add lower bound for additional time needed
- If remaining vehicles is less than needed prune it
- Add a algorithm for minimum cars needed
- Add a simple lower bound to the branch and    bound
- Add calculation time to the main function
- Add Last Depot Due Date
- Add a stub function for lower bound
- Remove early arriving penalty
- Fix vehicle start time, timeElapsed, arrival time, ...
- Improve printPath function show service times, and penalties on that vertex
- Improve the printPath function
- Move the redundant adding to priority queue code to a subroutine
- Add time to the cost.

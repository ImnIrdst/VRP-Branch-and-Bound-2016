# About
A solution to Vehicle Routing Problem with Due Dates (VRPD) using Branch and Bound

# Todo
- Add lower bound to the branch and bound


# Done
- Fix vehicle start time, timeElapsed, arrival time, ...
- Improve printPath function show service times, and penalties on that vertex
- Improve the printPath function
- Move the redundant adding to priority queue code to a subroutine
- Add time to the cost.

# Ideas
- Use knapsack for lower bound
- Use vehicles (and their paths) to produce branch and bound nodes
